Here is some code you can use for your Vulkan apps.
We based it on Android, but you can EASILY add some ViB to support any OS.
Or make it into an OS itself?

# It is very simple.

VBC'c has all the cpu and gpu ViB'c you need to program.
All the VBC'c ViB'c are used via Ce, Be, Vee, and Pec functions.

Ce is to create it.
Be is to change it for your specific use case.
Vee is to use it.
Pec is to destroy it.

If you explore the header files (except for Vulkan_Wrapper and Jeneral files) and you will see a class (which is the ViB)
and each class defines these 4 function header; Member variables in the class are assigned via these functions.
                
The Source files simply define these 4 functions for the class. After looking at a couple, you will see a pattern that will help you learn the rest.
        
The CpuCoul is your cpu thread, and it processes cpu instructions on address space allocated by a CpuBar. It also calls VBC'c Vee function for when you require other ViB'c.
The CpuCoul is the Coul of VBC'c. Write programs for it to execute. It's very easy to set up.

# Explore these 4 functions carefully.

They do more than simplify the Vulkan API.

These 4 functions emerged from Von's Buffet's special equation.

The equation helped us do more than create this (which is essentially an operating system framework).

We have studied the equation excessively. And built systems using this code as a starting point.

You still use primitive technology don't you? kk, our face of contact sometimes uses email: TheVoniestMichael@VonsBuffet.ca

# Extra Sauce

For best experience, use Android Studio, or any editor that supports: //region syntax for code folding.

If you wanna help me add some more ViB to this, eg. for traditional graphics programming, tools and tricks, etc. Contact us through your spirits.
