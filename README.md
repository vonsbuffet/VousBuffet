Here is some code you can use for your Vulkan apps.
We based it on Android, but you can EASILY add some ViB to support any OS.
Or make it into an OS itself?

# It is very simple.

VBC'c has all the cpu and gpu ViB'c you need to program.

All the ViB'c are defined via 4 functions:

Ce - create it.
</br>Be - change it.
</br>Vee - use it.
</br>Pec - destroy it.

# Look Around

Start by exploring the header files of each ViB, class member variables explain what they do.
</br>(Try a ViB in the Cpu directory?)

</br>Header files define a class (the "ViB") that declares the 4 functions, where member variables are assigned.
</br>The Source files define the 4 functions for the class.

After looking at a couple ViB, you will see a pattern that will help you learn the rest.

(Vulkan_Wrapper and Jeneral files are extra sauce, look at them if you want.)

# To Start

Try creating a startup routine that initializes your VBC'c.

Use vbcc.Be and vbcc.Vee calls, to create everything you need to get up and running.

Start with a large 'empty' float array, and an iterator. (once you know your order, you will know how big to make the array)

Look through the VBCc->Be branches to decide on what floats you need to make it do what you want.
</br>Do The Same for VBCc->Vee branches.
</br>You will see a // F or // D or // P next to relevant points where you can order from.

You can also run orders during runtime in the same way. Search through CpuCoul->Vee and find the "vbcc.Vee" call in the VB region.
</br>I understand the CpuCoul may seem a bit complicated,
</br>but it is a simple virtual machine that runs virtual machine code optimized for AI.

You can change the CpuCoul to be the virtual machine of your choice, and program it.
</br>Or learn to use ours, because we know what we're doing.

Very Fun!

# Explore these 4 functions carefully.

They do more than simplify the Vulkan API.

These 4 functions emerged from Von's Buffet's special equation.

The equation helped us do more than create this.

We have studied the equation excessively, and this code is indeed a starting point to do more with the equation.

You still use primitive technology? kk, our contact may use email: TheVoniestMichael@VonsBuffet.ca

# Extra Sauce

For best experience, use Android Studio, or any editor that supports code folding via: "//region //endregion" syntax.

If you want us to add some more ViB to this, eg. for traditional graphics programming, tools and tricks, etc. Contact us through your spirits.
