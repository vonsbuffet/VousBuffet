# VousBuffet

Here is some code you can use for your Vulkan apps.
We based it on Android, but you can EASILY add some ViB to support any OS.
Or make it into an OS itself?

# It is very simple.

VBC'c has all the cpu and gpu ViB'c you need to get things done.

All the ViB'c are defined via 4 functions:

Ce - create it.
</br>Be - change it.
</br>Vee - use it.
</br>Pec - destroy it.

# Look Around

Header files define a class that declares 4 functions and member variables.
</br>Source files define 4 functions for the class; where member variables come to life.

After a couple ViB, you will see a pattern that will help you learn the rest.

(Vulkan_Wrapper and Jeneral files are extra sauce, look around them when you can.)

# To Start

Use vbcc.Be and vbcc.Vee calls, to create everything you need to get up and running.

Explore VBCc->Be branches to decide on what you need to make it do what you want.
</br>Explore VBCc->Vee the same way.
</br>(Speed Tip: You will see a // F or // D or // P next to relevant points where you can order from. See Jeneral.cpp for the format.)

Similarly, you can also run orders during runtime.
</br>Search through CpuCoul->Vee and find the "vbcc.Vee" call in the VB region.

Very Fun!

# Explore 4 functions carefully.

They do more than add order to the Vulkan API.

4 funs emerged from Von's Buffet's special equation.

The equation helped us do more than create this.

We have studied the equation excessively, and this code is indeed a starting point to do more with the equation.

# Extra Sauce

For best experience, use Android Studio, or an editor that supports code folding, via: '//region' syntax.

If you want to see more ViB, eg. for graphics, tools, tricks, etc. Contact us through your spirits.

# Smart Flex

We are looking to reinforce the smartest brains on the planet.
</br>We are in this together. Everything has it's place. No1 needs to die.

(Perhaps, maybe, an alien or 2... aha >:)

So who has the brains? :(

Who wants more? :)
