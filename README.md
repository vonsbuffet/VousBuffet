# VousBuffet

Here is some code you can use for your Vulkan apps.
We based it on Android, but you can EASILY add some ViB to support any OS.
Or make it into an OS itself?

# It is very simple.

VBC'c has all the cpu and gpu ViB'c you need to get things done.

All the ViB'c are defined via 4 functions:

Ce - create it.
</br>Be - change it.
</br>Vee - use it.
</br>Pec - destroy it.

# Look Around

Start by exploring ViB header files.

Header files define a class that declares 4 functions and member variables.
</br>Source files define 4 functions for the class; where member variables come to life.

After a couple ViB, you will see a pattern that will help you learn the rest.

(Vulkan_Wrapper and Jeneral files are extra sauce, look around them when you can.)

# To Start

Try creating a startup routine that initializes your VBC'c.

Use vbcc.Be and vbcc.Vee calls, to create everything you need to get up and running.

Start with a large 'empty' float array, and an iterator. (once you know your order, you will know how big to make the array)

Explore VBCc->Be branches to decide on what floats you need to make it do what you want.
</br>Explore VBCc->Vee branches the same way.
</br>(Speed Tip: You will see a // F or // D or // P next to relevant points where you can order from. See Jeneral.cpp for the format.)

You can also run orders during runtime in the same way. Search through CpuCoul->Vee and find the "vbcc.Vee" call in the VB region.
</br>The CpuCoul may seem a bit complicated,
</br>but it's really simple virtual machine that runs virtual machine code optimized for AI.

You can change the CpuCoul to be the virtual machine of your choice, and program it?
</br>You can add a compiler ViB to compute real machine code, and jump to the raw instructions with the CpuCoul?
</br>Or you can learn to use our Coul, and it will give you super powers.

Very Fun!

# Explore 4 functions carefully.

They do more than add order to the Vulkan API.

4 functions emerged from Von's Buffet's special equation.

The equation helped us do more than create this.

We have studied the equation excessively, and this code is indeed a starting point to do more with the equation.

# Extra Sauce

For best experience, use Android Studio, or any editor that supports code folding via: '//region' syntax.

If you want us to add more ViB, eg. for graphics, tools, tricks, etc. Contact us through your spirits.

So who has the brains? :(

Who wants more? :)
